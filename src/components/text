for reference and for further knowlege 
we have some four important method which plays an important role in react 

1. render
2. component did mount
3. component did update
4. component will unmount

in terms of chronlogy : construtor runs first then render 
render basically implies rendering of elements or html whcih it has in the form of jsx, we cannot use set state function or method inside of an render 
it is not allowed
component did method runs at the last
